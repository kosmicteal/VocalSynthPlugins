Plugins for various Signing Voice Synthesizers that allow scripting ([you can also donate in case these scripts helped you a bit](https://ko-fi.com/osformula) winkwink)

## V○CAL○ID3/4 (.lua)
**How to install them?**: Download your desired .lua files and drop them in (Program Files)\V○CAL○IDX\Editor\J○bPlugins (where X is your editor version), then in V3/V4 go to Job(J) -> Manage Job Plugins (M)
* **ListKeyNotes**: Create same-length notes in a specific key
  * **How it works?**: Set the Position wherever you want the notes and run the Plug-in. Everything else is self-explanatory.
* **Crash-B-Gone for Tonio**: Replaces all @ for V
  * **How it works?**: Choose a part in a VSQx and run the Plug-in.

# Note
As we don't know what's going to happen in the future with this synth or its compatibilities with future Windows OS, always make a backup of the file before running any plugin.
